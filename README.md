(Comments -- Text subtracted of private own documentation. For more info contact me)

This is my biggest project until the date. Contact me whatever is your doubt! I passed my final project of 3 months with a mark of 10. I spent a lot of hours in the development of this project. For more questions asked me.

In the following document the work developed for the realization of an administrative management system for dental clinics is exposed, 
which combines a server part performed in an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) called Odoo, together with a client part developed in Android.


The objective of the developed environment is the integration of smalls dental clinics with a tight budget, to the technologies of 21st century. 

In addition, it permits the integration with the client through an Android App without the need for excessive implementation costs.

The document contains all kinds of information about the development of the full environment, from analyse part, through in programming, testing and possible ways and future improvements of the same, obviously for both apps (Odoo and Android).

Technologies and design APP for Android: Java 13, Android, XMLRPC, AsyncTask, MVVM, API Odoo ...
Technologies and design intranet: Odoo 13, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, PostgreSQL, own modules devloped very specific ...
Design and analysis: Visual paradigm, differents mock-ups


I attach this image. You can show both apps (Intranet(Odoo) and Client App(Android)) running at the same time. Also, I attach a video in which you can see all explanation about the project. Take a look and give me your feedback.
