<i>"This is my biggest project until the date. I passed my final project of 3 months with a mark of 10. I spent a lot of hours in the development of this project. For more questions asked me.

<i>In the following document the work developed for the realization of an administrative management system for dental clinics is exposed, 
which combines a server part performed in an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) called Odoo, together with a client part developed in Android.</i>


<i>The objective of the developed environment is the integration of smalls dental clinics with a tight budget, to the technologies of 21st century. </i>
